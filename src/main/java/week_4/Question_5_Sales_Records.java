    /*A t-shirt vendor  LOCATION and WEEK SALES for each is working at a week-long event that runs from Monday until Sunday. They would like a program that saves their sales for each day, and does some analysis on their sales.

Use a loop to ask for the number of t-shirts sold for every day of the week.  A list of the days of the weeks may be useful.

Once the user has entered all the data, calculate and print the total for the week, and the average daily sales for the week.

Print all the data, one day and number of t-shirts sold, per line. If the day is above or equal to the average, include an up arrow ↑

If the day is below average, include a down arrow ↓

Example output:
 The tests don't know what type of data structure you'll use, so they can't test this program very easily.
 So, the way the tests work is to add data, and then try to calculate the fastest time and see if everything seems
 to be working. So, *none of the tests will pass until you've finished the testFastestTimeForLake method*.

 Your program should use the generic types of data structures.
 You should use methods to organize your program.
 Hint: you may need to combine more than one type of data structure.
