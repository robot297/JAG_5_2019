/**

 You are a runner, and you are in training for a race. You'd like to keep track of all of your
 times for your training runs. You only like to run around lakes. Here's some example data,
 Cedar, 45.15
 Cedar, 43.32
 Harriet, 49.34
 Harriet, 44.43
 Harriet, 46.22
 Como, 32.11
 Como, 28.14

 Write a program that enables you to enter the names of lakes and times, and store it all of this
 data in data structure(s). You'll need to save every time entered for each lake.

 Don't store it in individual variables. Your program should still work if you started running
 around another lake too (e.g. Lake of the Isles, or Lake Phalen).

 Your program should be able to analyze the data that you have stored, and print your fastest
 time for each lake you ran around. So, for the data above, your program will display something like

 Cedar, 43.32
 Harriet, 44.43
 Como, 32.11

 Your program should be case-insensitive. So "Como" is the same lake as "como" or "COMO".

 Your program should use the generic types of data structures.
 You should use methods to organize your program.
 Hint: you may need to combine more than one type of data structure.
